## Overview
A few related neural network projects implemented with Python. The logic for the models is completely written with NumPy. Each model is implemented using the object oriented paradigm. There are models for both classification and regression tasks:
* Age prediction
* Heart attack risk prediction
* FashionMnist classification

There are the following models:
* Fully connected neural network - both classification and regression
* Autoencoder trained on FashionMnist data and used for training a classification neural network
* Convolutional autonecoder
